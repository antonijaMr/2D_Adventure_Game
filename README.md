2D Adventure Game in Java

Learining how to develop 2D games using Java.

Idea is to have a 2D adventure game. 
For now I implemented Player, moving camera that follows the player, collision with specific objects.
Interaction between objects like collecting a key and opening a door to get to a chest/prise.
I also added following sound effects. 
Learing about java swing libray, threads, timers, jpanels etc.
